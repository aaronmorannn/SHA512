# Theory of Algorithms Project 2021
For our Theory of Algorithms project we have been tasked with writing a program in the C programming language to calculate the SHA512 value of an input file. The program also must incorporate command line arguments to receive the file location. The use of any external libraries is prohibited and we are strictly only allowed to use the C standard library.

## Deployment
* First you will need to have a Ubuntu or Debian subsystem installed to run the code through the windows terminal. You can find resources to download from the link below.
[Ubuntu Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* Once you have your subsystem installed, you should clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Moran98/TOA
```
* To compile the code use the following command inside of the 'TOA' directory:
```
gcc -o sha512 sha512.c
```
* Once the code has been compiled run the command to execute the file:
```
./sha512
```
